## What are Binary Options?

Binary options are a type of financial instrument that allows you to
speculate on the future direction of an asset\'s price. They are called
binary because there are only two possible outcomes: you either win or
you lose. This makes them a very simple and straightforward way to
trade.

## How do Binary Options Work?

When you trade binary options, you are essentially betting on whether
the price of an asset will go up or down within a certain period of
time. If you correctly predict the direction of the price movement, you
will win a payout. If you incorrectly predict the direction of the price
movement, you will lose your investment.
